  <h2>New Arrivals, Old Trouble</h2>
  <div class="imgFloatLeft"> <img src="img/tales/tales1.png" alt=""><br>
   <div class="desc">Vengeanze and Ozabo were the life and soul of any party. And the death of many, too!</div>
  </div>
  <p>Roshko nervously adjusted his uniforn as he waited in the sumptuous reception of Khordovsky's HQ building. He had been summoned here by messenger, out of the blue, just an hour ago. "Why can't he just drop it" he thought bitterly to himself, "It takes two to tango".</p>
  <p>Suddenly the door to the office opened and a gorgeous young woman called his name.</p>
  <p>Never one to miss an oportunity, Roshko handed her an application form for the Smalltownthatwasdefinitelynotcapturedbythegermansandisareallyniceplacetovisit School of Parachute Packing and walked into the lions den. "Well?" barked the bearded tub of lard sat behind the vast mahogany desk, "How are they getting on?" Confused, Roshko raised his eyebrows, relieved that this was NOT about what he had feared, and asked "Who, sir?" "The two new ace pilots I sent you replace Zabo and Reakin!" replied Khordovsky. "Umm, do you mean Zulu and Raven, sir?" Roshko enquired, inwardly impressed at just how little a man could know of those who work, and die, for him. "Yes, them, that is what I said is it not, K.E. Roshko?" "Yessir, exactly sir, sorry sir, still got slightly bad ears after the bombing raid we suffered last week," repied the chastened officer, "but I still do not know to whom you are referring regarding the two new pilots."</p>
  <p>Khordovsky leapt to his feet and strode round the desk until he was inches from Roshko's face. "WHAT?" he bellowed, "You have missplaced two of the finest pilots in the VVS through incompetence? It is a wonder I do not have you shot right now!" "I'll look right into it, sir." said Roshko, "It was probably a clerical error by my useless admin assistant Zhukov, I will have him beaten. I will report on the new pilots within the day."</p>
  <p>Cursing the young political officer under his breath, Roshko left the HQ and climbed back into the jeep where Venom was waiting to drive him back to base. "I don't know," he said, more to himself than to Venom, "It is all very well being stupefyingly brave, totally politically correct, and having control over the performance reviews, but if Zhukov cannot lay off the Vodka and stop cocking up the squadron paperwork I shall have to have strong words with him". Venom sniggered under his breath. A short drive later they pulled into the GeeYap base and stopped outside the command building. Roshko was out of the jeep even before it properly stopped, and in the door of the office. "ZHUKOV!" he yelled, "have you lost some MORE pilots?"</p>
  <p>There was no-one there. A cigar was smouldering in the ashtray, and several highly classified documents were strewn over the desk, including Olga's latest requisition form for silk stockings and some decidedly decadent items from a western 'Adult' catalogue she had found (APPROVED was stamped in big red letters over the form). Roshko sat back in the chair, put his feet up, picked up the cigar and waited. A few minutes later a flustered looking political officer Zhukov came into the room followed by two of the scruffiest, illest looking men that Roshko had seen since the last time he attended the All-Ukraine Postal-Chess-Players conference. "Allow me to intoduce you to Kadets Ozabo and Vengeanze" he said to his commander. " And can you explain where these men have been for the last 10 days and why I now have a choice of orrifices to use in the latrine after my visit to Khordovsky?" asked Roshko calmly.</p>
  <p>"Well sir, it is like this," said Zhukov. "Ten days ago, these two arrived at the front gate, which was being manned by Chap and Tooz". Roshko's heart sank. When those two names were mentioned in the same sentence after a mission, it had usually been a huge success, but when they were mentioned in relation to non-aerial matters, disaster was never far away. "It appears that Tooz suggested that they be shown around the local town before coming back to sign in at the base. That was 10 days ago. Tooz and Chap were back that night, but, for quite understandable reasons, did not mention the two, now missing, pilots that you see here. Theye were brought back 2 days ago by a rather smug group of pilots form the 33rd Shap squadron, having been found in somewhat delicate circumstances."</p>
  <p>"Delicate?" enquired Roshko with icy calm. "Well sir, the squadron funds have taken a bit of a hit but I think I have smoothed things over. The local bar has got a full new set of furniture and glasses, the medical centre has been thoroughly sterilzed and received a new ambulance, and Venom owes the chief of police 4 free deliveries of illegal fuel". "I decided that you would not wish to be involved in these things, and so locked the miscreants in the guardhouse until they were feeling better and things had blown over. I did not realize that these men were handpicked by Khordovsky. By the way, I have consulted my source at HQ and he tells me that these two used to fly for Khordovsky's nephews squadron, and are emphatically NOT being transferred due to outstanding skill. Apparently there is a petition out among local people there to have them shot, and the man who ran the bar near the base has bought himself a dacha next to Stalin."</p>
  <p>"A fine addition to our squadron then," smiled Roshko, placing an arm around each mans shoulders and leading them off to the bar. "You fellows play chess........?"</p>

  <h2>In from the cold</h2>
  <div class="imgFloatLeft"> <img src="img/tales/tales2.png" alt=""><br>
   <div class="desc">Chap must abandon the cozy warmth of the mess when Zhukov orders him on perimeter patrol.</div>
  </div>
  <p>The weather was unbelievably bad. It was minus 20, blowing a gale, snowing heavily and pitch black. Chap had scored 2 more victories the previous day and had been dragged from the mess by Zhukov and put on perimiter patrol. Apparently one of Zhukov's sources had heard of a German infiltration operation in the area and someone had to freeze their nuts off to protect the base, might as well be Chap. Luckily Chap had been quick witted enough to slip a bottle of Vodka in his tunic, and was using it liberally to keep himself warm. He knew the warmth it gave was an illusion, but he didn't care.</p>
  <p>Truth be told, any excuse would do. He was rounding the far end of the runway, humming merrily to himself as he contemplated the fact that his route would pass the parachute store in a little while when, to his utter disbelief, he heard an aero-engine. What idiot would try and fly in this weather? Even Venom, whose not-quite-as-secret-as-he-thought fuel smuggling business required night time deliveries was not stupid enough to try and take off in this. Well, actually he was, but Chap was pretty sure Venom had slipped under the table in the mess in the middle of the last chess match they had played before Zook had arrived. He turned and began to head back to the parking strip when he suddenly realised that he MUST be mad. The engine was in the air, and getting closer. And it was German.</p>
  <p>"That Zhukov sure knows his stuff" he thought admiringly, remembering the countless other times the young political officer had saved the day. He started to run to the nearest AAA gun to wake the crew. He knew it was as impossible to hit a plane in this visibility as it was to fly one, but the Germans were flying one so he was determined to hit one. Before he could reach the gun, he heard the engine throttling back and descending. "No time for the gun", he thought, the bugger's on top of us. He dived to the ground as a single 190 swooped out of the dark night and nearly crashed into one of the base hangers. He unslung his rifle and tried to sight the disappearing Focke-Wulf, but it was jinking and wobbling its wings, and had made no effort to shoot up the base. Intrigued now, he headed back to the runway.</p>
  <div class="imgFloatLeft"> <img src="img/tales/tales3.png" alt=""><br>
   <div class="desc">The 190 was on him before he could reach the AAA</div>
  </div>
  <p>He had heard tales of desertions from the OKL, mainly following Zhukov's superb idea of dropping pictures of Olga over enemy bases, and suspected that this might be a desperate German. Taking the executive decision to find out, he dropped to his knees and pulled out his copy (they all had one) of K.E. Roshko's literary masterpiece 'Chess games I have won and how I won them', currently number 1789951 on the Pravda bestseller list (8 copies sold, co-incidentally the same as the number of pilots under Roshko's command). He quickly lit it and threw it onto the runway.</p>
  <p>Nervously, Chap stood there. Silence. Had he made a fool of himself? Was he going to have to buy another copy of that blasted book? No! Here came the plane, and it was definitely landing.</p>
  <p>This he wanted to see. A couple of minutes later there was a terrible crunching noise and immediately afterwards a 190 came sliding down the runway, sparks flying, it's undercarriage splayed out underneath it. It stopped a few yards past Chap who pointed his rifle at it menacingly.</p>
  <p>Silence descended over the snowy scene, broken by the tick of cooling metal. Then the canopy popped off and a vision of loveliness emerged from the wrecked aircraft. Long blond hair on a tall perfectly proportioned body covered in a floorlength blue dress. The face was obscured by the flying helmet and visor, but the chest was not. Phooooooo-weeeee. Chap lowered his rifle and began to step forward. Suddenly another engine split the silence and a jeep roared out of the darkness, skidded in front of Chap and halted next to the mysterious arrival. Marx stepped out, immaculate in his best uniform, his cap at a jaunty angle.</p>
  <p>He grabbed the ladies hand, pressed it to his lips and said "Welcome to my base, Fraulein, X.O. Marx at your service, may I take you to my quarters, they are very warm.". The visitor removed the flying gear, revealing a full beard, a scarred cheek and a twinkle in the eye. "Why thank you sir" she growled, "you are too kind". Marx span on his heel, pulled his pistol from it's holster and pointed it at Chap, who had collapsed to the ground in hysterics. "You tell anyone about this, anyone at all, and I'll have your nuts" he whispered before stalking off into the night.</p>
  <p>Chap got back to his feet and, gun at the ready again, ushered the new arrival towards the guard house. On the way, the story emerged. The young mans name was Akula, and he was raised in Germany by foreign parents. Upon being drafted into the Wehrmacht and sent east, he had resolved to desert at the first opportunity. He never let on that he was a qualified pilot, and the Germans foolishly sent him on an errand to the base where the JG51 were stationed. At the point of a gun he stole Kommandant Swein's girlfriend's clothes, took a few pictures, donned the wig he had fashioned over the last few months from cow-tail-hair, and slipped through security out to the rank of FWs. He had a 2 minute start before anyone heard him start the engine, and no-one was crazy enough to follow him into the sky. He had planned to fly east and bail, taking his chances, but at the last second had spotted the shapes of parked planes below and decided to risk it. He was about to give up after nearly crashing on his first approach when he saw the fire laid by Chap. With nothing to lose, he gave it a go, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
  <p>Akula applied for a position in the GeeYap, and, on the strength of his landing skills, and over Marx's strenuous objections, Roshko granted his request. In honor of his arrival, the Squad now hold a bi-monthly cross dressing dinner, which Marx boycotts. Olga comes, though, and looks very manly dressed as a Ukranian goat-herder.</p>

  <h2>Strangerer and Strangerer</h2>
  <div class="imgFloatLeft"> <img src="img/tales/tales4.png" alt=""><br>
   <div class="desc">Well, that was one less 109 to worry about' thought Marx with satisfaction</div>
  </div>
  <p>The Geeyap was on a roll. Flying a mix of Ground Attack and air to air missions they had made a significant impact on the enemy. Bomber kills, especially by the indomitable (according to him) or lucky (according to Venom) Zhukov were high, while the expert dogfighters, Roshko, Marx, Chap, Raven and Zulu were clearing the hated 109s from the skies.</p>
  <p>One bright afternoon the guys were up on a difficult mission. A heavy hun offensive was predicted and losses were expected to be severe on both sides. The 69ers were up for it. Zhukov, who had suffered an unexplained recurrence of an old knee injury, sustained at ballet class when he was 6, was reclining in his chair in the morale office, idly amending performance reviews when he heard the guards shouting excitedly.</p>
  <p>He got to his feet and stretched before wandering over to his office door to demand that Dimitri, his batman, get the noise turned down. Dimitri replied that a convoy of cars and trucks had just arrived from Headqurters, including Marshall Khordovsky. Everyone knew of Roshko and Khordovsky's personal animosity following the daughter/desk incident, so Zhukov hurried to pull out Roshkos latest performance review. Under the democratic, 360 degree, review system, all pilots got to review the senior officers as well as being reviewed themselves. While finding this an admirable policy in principle, Zhukov felt it did not ideally suit a squadron that he was a part of. So he meticulously kept a series of parallel reports, imaginatively detailing some of the darker sides of the key pilots. Venom's extensive theft of gasoline for his flourishing blackmarket business, Roshko's use of repair funds for a new car for his mother, Tooz's frequent abscences from active duty while in the VD hospital, things like this littered these alternative reports. Yanking Roshkos 'alternative' file, he marched out to the parade ground, his pronounced limp on the other side from this morning. Khordovsky waved him impatiently away and demanded the base be sealed, the runway cleared of ground crew vehicles, and a car and truck from his convoy be allowed private axis to the taxiway. This was of course complied with as the trucks were full of Interior ministry special forces troops.</p>
  <div class="imgFloatLeft"> <img src="img/tales/tales5.png" alt=""><br>
   <div class="desc"> Even Zhukov was not allowed to go to meet the planes.</div>
  </div>
  <p>While Khordovsky's car made its way off to the taxiway, another truck drove to the barracks. More troops emerged, cleared the barracks, and then went in alone. They came out carrying several boxes. Then silence decended on the puzzled base.</p>
  <p>After an hour or so, aero engines became audible. The squadron began to trickle back, the fabric covers blown from their gun muzzles, several with bullet holes in the wings and tail. One by one they landed and were sheperded over to where the senior officer waited silently and the pilots lined up. Eventually all were back, a good mission. Khordovsky addressed the pilots for a few minutes before two of them stepped forward and climbed into the back of the truck. Zhukov thought he recognized Raven's languid, laid back gait and Zulu's wild helmet hair (he kept his hair long and always looked a state after a mission).</p>
  <p>Khordovsky climbed back into his car, the troops piled ino the truck and they roared off, not stopping, out of the base and onto the main highway back to town. As the pilots began to walk back to the mess, curious groundcrew went into the barracks, only to rush out shouting that Zulu and Raven's quarters had been cleared. Completely.</p>
  <p>Zhukov quickly dashed to the office and returned Roshko's file to his locked cabinet and returned to meet the squad, remembering at the last second how much his leg hurt.</p>
  <p>And that was that. No more was heard of the matter. It was mentioned in whispers in quiet corners of the bar, but no-one wanted to talk outloud, especially the pilots. Rumors circulated of a new secret operations squadron, but nothing was ever heard. RAF successes however rose dramatically soon afterwards.</p>

  <h2>How the boss lost his toes</h2>
  <div class="imgFloatLeft"> <img src="img/tales/tales6.png" alt=""><br>
   <div class="desc">Roshko described the thrill of terrifying raw recruits during combat training</div>
  </div>
  <p>It was December 1940. A young and upcoming VVS officer, Roshko of the 69GIAP, is summoned to a glittering ball at VVS headquarters. Promotion is almost guaranteed after attending one of these events. Young Roshko is feeling nervous and stiffens his nerves with a few shots of the expensive Vodka that is flowing freely.</p>
  <p>With his inhibitions loosened, his attention turned to a group of stunning young ladies dressed in expensive Western frocks, showing plenty of cleavage. Roshko had been whipping his section into shape for months now, stuck on a remote airfield near Lvov, with no female company. He wondered if his legendeary skills, which had earned him the name Roshko the Rogerer back home, had faded at all. His last practice had been with the new parachute packer on base, but all the evidence pointed to her having a 'thing' for pilots in uniform, and so he didn't count her as much of a challenge. I mean, even Marx had succeeded, and his chat-up techniques were legendarily bad.</p>
  <p>He sauntered over and introduced himself. His opening remarks about his glory days as Ukarainian postal-chess champion seemed to have the wrong effect on 2 of the girls, but Adriana and Natasha seemed riveted. He moved on to recounting the thrill of open cockpit flying, describing the way his hair blew in the wind as he dived his Ishak onto an unsuspecting recruits tail and scared him into a clean uniform. They lapped it up, touching his arm and leaning in close to catch the details.</p>
  <p>Roshko decided it was time to make a move. He suggested quietly to Natasha that they find a quieter spot, but she insisted that her friend accompany her. Roshko's spirits sagged until Adriana squeezed his bottom and remarked how nice uniforms looked on or off a man.</p>
  <p>Roshko decided it was time to make a move. He suggested quietly to Natasha that they find a quieter spot, but she insisted that her friend accompany her. Roshko's spirits sagged until Adriana squeezed his bottom and remarked how nice uniforms looked on or off a man. With a girl on each arm, Roshko slipped out of the great ballroom and headed down a corridor. His mischievous heart leaped when he saw the door marked 'Khordhovsky-head of VVS West'. What a coup to have these girls on a senior officers desk!!!</p>
  <div class="imgFloatLeft"> <img src="img/tales/tales7.png" alt=""><br>
   <div class="desc">It was cold in the converted PE8, but colder at Roshko's destination.</div>
  </div>
  <p>10 minutes later the door opened and a tall bearded officer strolled in and stopped dead, his cigar falling to the ground. 'Adriana, what in Stalins name do you think you are doing'? he roared. The girl giggled and stood up from over the chair, while Natasha climbed off the desk. 'Why Daddy, I was just showing the nice officer your office' replied Adraina.</p>
  <p>Within 30 minutes Roshko was on a transport heading east to Siberia. His time there was hard, and the guards took his boots on the second day. After 2 weeks, Khordovsky relented, since he had subsequently caught his daughter with 4 other officers, and decided that it was not his place to singlehandedly ship the Red Army to Siberia.</p>
  <p>So Roshko appeared back at the airfield, bundled out of the back of a truck with his belongings in a bag in one hand and his amputated toes in a bag in the other. His first stop was at the stores, to order a pair of modified boots.</p>
  <img src="img/main/grafic_h1Line.png"></img>
  <h2>Tooz' Hazing</h2>
  <p>There are regiments that inspire nerves in their new recruits, there are regiments that inspire resignation, there are regiments that inspire pride.</p>
  <p>But only the 69ers could simultaneously imbue it's new pilots with fear, pride, resignation, happiness and, during parachute training, lust.</p>
  <p>When Cadet Tooz received orders to quit his farm in Krasnoyarsk and report to the Geeyap base, it's reputation had already spread far enough for him to experience all these emotions. Well, except lust. Olga was a closely guarded regimental secret, and not revealed to outsiders lest the 25th infantry division launch another kidnap attempt, as happened when word got out about Natsha at the 33rd GIAP.</p>
  <p>Upon arrival he was marched to meet Roshko who was standing in front of a burnt out, smashed up Ishak. This was designed to let the recruit know, right from the get go that this was a life and death business, and it was not until months later that the greenhorn would be let in on the fact that Zulu had destroyed the plane playing drunken taxiway tag with a farmer and his tractor who he had met in a bar.</p>
  <p>Tooz was sent up for what was described as an evaluation flight, on Zhukov's wing. They were climbing throgh angels 2 over the base when a swarm of dark shapes fell on him out of the clouds. With metres to spare, Raven and Chap peeled left and right, leaving Tooz yawing in their slipstream and yabbering profanities into his radio. Upon landing he was presented with his ceremonial GeeYap clean pair of pants.</p>
  <p>He held his nerve in the face of all the tests, and was provisionally admitted to the squadron, where Roshko cofidently expects him to do well, and Zhukov fervently hopes he doesn't do better than him.</p>
  <img src="img/main/grafic_h1Line.png"></img>
  <h2>The birth of a catchphrase</h2>
  </p>
  <div class="imgFloatLeftPortrait"> <img src="img/tales/tales8.png" alt=""><br>
   <div class="desc">He bailed out, confident in Olga's packing ability</div>
  </div>
  <p>Olga had been with the squadron since it's inception. Rumors that she was Roshko's sister were squashed early on with loss of only a few pilots to the Siberian Gulags.</p>
  <p>She worked primarily in the parachute store ensuring that should any of 'her boys' be shot down, at least they didn't have to worry about their chute not opening. She would also ensure that any hurt masculine pride was suitably healed that evening.</p>
  <p>Anyway, one day early in the war, the Geeyap was up on patrol over Lvov when they were bounced by a superior force of 109s. The battle was fierce but short, and the better turning ability of the Ishak, plus of course the superior ability of the Russian pilots, ensured that casualties were low. In fact, only Raven was hit, caught by cannon fire as he was about to nail a BF. Losing his elevator control renedered him essentially helpless and he bailed out, confident in Olga's packing ability.</p>
  <p>After disengagement, the squadron headed home, having seen a Russian truck collect Raven from his landing site. A couple of hours after they landed, a clapped out Red Army truck pulled into the field, belching clouds of smoke. Raven quickly put out his cigar. Olga came rushing over from her quarters to make sure he was ok and, under the transparent excuse of wanting to 'debrief' him about the chute's performance, led him away to her room.</p>
  <p>He didn't show for dinner.</p>
  <p>Early the next morning, the alarms sounded for the scramble and the pilots piled out of the barracks and ran to the planes. Except Raven, who piled out of Olga's room, hopping while pulling on one flight boot. It was bitterly cold and as we gathered round Roshko for a snap-brief, Raven began to shiver uncontrolably. He quickly checked his clothing before shouting "Yegods, where's my vest?"</p>
  <p>Roshko turns to him and barks, "Raven, you have 20 seconds to get your vest and get in your kite or you will be peeling potatoes for the 54th Divisions Christmas dinner." Raven bolted for his vest and quickly returned. As he climbed into his plane he turned and shouted to the rest of us <b>"Scratch my last, Onwards to the west!!!!!!"</b>.</p>
  <img src="img/main/grafic_h1Line.png"></img>
  <h2>Not all fun and games</h2>
  <p>It was a tough mission. The 69ers were up hunting HE111s and found 4 of them escorted by 4 109s.
   After a fierce fight the HEs were down along with a 109 and 2 of the newest recruits to the Geeyap. Chap had taken mg bullets in the engine trying to protect the 19 year old pilot he was flying with and landed hard near the airfield. He took the death of his protégé badly and spent the evening drinking heavily in the mess.</p>
  <p>Marx, who shared quarters with Chap, was up early the next morning planning to clean his guns ready for revenge, but when he went to pull on his flight boots found that Chap had felt it was too far to walk to the latrine in the cold winter and had simply used Marx's left boot as a receptacle……</p>
  <p>Roshko was making his regular field inspection at 6am and was just in time to prevent Marx flicking the ignition in his Ishak. Chap was strapped to the prop with the soiled boot tied to his head, still unconscious.</p>
  <p>Disaster was averted, and upon the receipt of a new pair of fur-lined boots, the correct size this time, Marx decided that maybe Chap had done him a favour.</p>
  <p>Drinks all round, and then back to gerry hunting.<br>
